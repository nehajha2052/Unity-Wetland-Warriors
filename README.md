# Wetland-Warriors

Battle for the Bayou is an educational environmental game in which players help restore Louisiana's coastal wetlands by removing invasive species and investing in conservation eff orts. Our game aims to combine gaming and environmental education, with a focus on the preservation of Louisiana's wetlands. Inspired by the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act (CWPPRA), one of the primary goals of players is to control invasive nutria rats and restore native vegetation. The game's interactive challenges and educational insights aim to highlight the importance of wetlands preservation while also encouraging coastal stewardship.

## Game Goals:

### Invasive Species Management:

In order to lessen the negative eff ects that invasive species, like the nutria rat, have on the wetlands, players engage in invasive species management by working to drastically lower or eradicate invasive species populations.

### Habitat Restoration:

Players can aid in the restoration of habitats by planting native plants and repairing damaged areas. This helps to resuscitate the wetland ecosystem and encourages the return of native biodiversity.

### Environmental Education:

Inspired by real-world initiatives such as CWPPRA, the game seeks to educate players on the importance of wetlands, the challenges they face, and the conservation eff orts required to preserve them.

### Coastal Stewardship Promotion:

By taking part in the game's activities, players are encouraged to learn more about Louisiana's coastal issues and the importance of wetlands.
